            Cycling is a fast-paced endurance sport where athletes ride bicycles over long distances, testing their stamina, strategy, teamwork, and mental toughness. In road cycling races, such as the famous Tour de France, riders compete across varied terrain including flat roads, hills, and mountains, often covering hundreds of kilometers in multiple stages. Within a professional road cycling team, each rider has a specific role: the team leader (or general classification contender) aims to win the overall race; the domestiques support the leader by setting the pace, fetching water, and protecting them from wind; the sprinter specializes in high-speed finishes on flat stages; the climber excels in steep mountain sections; the time trialist performs best in solo races against the clock; and the road captain provides tactical guidance during the race. Together, these roles create a highly strategic and cooperative team dynamic despite cycling appearing to be an individual sport.
